# Facial Emotion Recognition with FER-2013 Dataset

This project is a Facial Emotion Recognition system built with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow/Keras. It utilizes the FER-2013 dataset from Kaggle to classify facial expressions into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.

## Dataset
The FER-2013 dataset contains 35,887 grayscale, 48x48 pixel face images with each image labeled as one of the seven emotions. The data is split into training and validation sets.

- **Train set**: 28,709 images
- **Validation set**: 7,178 images

The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: [FER-2013 dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013).

## Project Structure
- `train/`: Training images, organized by emotion labels.
- `test/`: Test/Validation images, organized by emotion labels.
- `model_training.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the code for data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Requirements
This project is developed in Python and requires the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `kaggle` (for downloading datasets from Kaggle)
- `opencv-python` (optional, for additional image preprocessing)


## Model Architecture
The model uses a deep CNN with several convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers:
1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from input images.
2. **Batch Normalization**: Normalize activations for stable and faster training.
3. **MaxPooling Layers**: Downsample feature maps.
4. **Dropout Layers**: Prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units during training.
5. **Dense Layers**: Final fully connected layers to classify emotions.

### Summary of the model:
```plaintext
Layer (type)                  Output Shape              Param #   
=================================================================
Conv2D-32, BatchNorm, ReLU, MaxPool, Dropout
Conv2D-64, BatchNorm, ReLU, MaxPool, Dropout
Flatten
Dense-1024 (ReLU)
Dropout
Output Layer (7 classes with softmax activation)
```

## Training the Model
1. **Data Augmentation**: Images are rescaled by a factor of 1/255 for normalization.
2. **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate scheduling using `ReduceLROnPlateau`.
3. **Loss Function**: Categorical cross-entropy.
4. **Metrics**: Accuracy.

```python
model.fit(
    train_generator,
    steps_per_epoch=num_train // batch_size,
    epochs=50,
    validation_data=validation_generator,
    validation_steps=num_val // batch_size
)
```

## Results
The model achieves approximately 50-60% validation accuracy after training on the FER-2013 dataset. Performance can vary based on hyperparameter tuning and training duration.

## Usage
To train the model:
1. Set up Kaggle API credentials (`kaggle.json`) in the notebook.
2. Run the notebook `model_training.ipynb` in Google Colab or locally.

To test the model:
1. Generate sample predictions on the validation set and visualize them.
2. Use `validation_generator` to feed test images and display predictions.

## Sample Predictions
This section displays a grid of sample images from the test set with their predicted emotion labels.

```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 10, figsize=(20, 4))
for i in range(10):
    axes[i].imshow(np.squeeze(x_test[i]), cmap='gray')
    axes[i].set_title(f"Label: {np.argmax(y_test[i])}")
    axes[i].axis('off')
plt.show()
```
